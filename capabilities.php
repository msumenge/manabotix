				Our results usually involve: 6DOF solutions and measurements for target bodies or environments, proprietary software to provide required databasing, interfaces, and decisions, and actuation via passive, active, or hybrid systems. We can provide intuitive reporting directly into client enterprise systems, as well as virtual immersive representations (user interfaces) of operating environments. Do you have a process that you know needs improvement, and need someone to provide an appropriate industrial solution? Then ask us!

					Our automation solutions are from pit through to port — loading operations, rail or truck transport, unload, stockpiling, and shipping — reducing OH&S incidents, increasing production and throughput rates, mitigating machine damage exposure, and improving reliability and uptime of assets.
					<br><br>
					Examples include: improved train load out operations — including remnant product on arrival and product profile on departure. As well as in-yard and ship loading solutions for standalone pose, skew management, terrain and ship hold measurements, vessel monitoring, and collision awareness.
